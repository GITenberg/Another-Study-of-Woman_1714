<h2><br>
 ANOTHER STUDY OF WOMAN</h2>

<p><br>
 At Paris there are almost always two separate parties going on
at<br>
 every ball and rout. First, an official party, composed of the
persons<br>
 invited, a fashionable and much-bored circle. Each one grimaces
for<br>
 his neighbor's eye; most of the younger women are there for one
person<br>
 only; when each woman has assured herself that for that one she
is the<br>
 handsomest woman in the room, and that the opinion is perhaps
shared<br>
 by a few others, a few insignificant phrases are exchanged, as:
"Do<br>
 you think of going away soon to La Crampade?" "How well Madame
de<br>
 Portenduere sang!" "Who is that little woman with such a load
of<br>
 diamonds?" Or, after firing off some smart epigrams, which
give<br>
 transient pleasure, and leave wounds that rankle long, the
groups thin<br>
 out, the mere lookers on go away, and the waxlights burn down to
the<br>
 sconces.</p>

<p><br>
 The mistress of the house then waylays a few artists, amusing
people<br>
 or intimate friends, saying, "Do not go yet; we will have a
snug<br>
 little supper." These collect in some small room. The second,
the real<br>
 party, now begins; a party where, as of old, every one can hear
what<br>
 is said, conversation is general, each one is bound to be witty
and to<br>
 contribute to the amusement of all. Everything is made to tell,
honest<br>
 laughter takes the place of the gloom which in company saddens
the<br>
 prettiest faces. In short, where the rout ends pleasure
begins.</p>

<p>The Rout, a cold display of luxury, a review of self-conceits
in full<br>
 dress, is one of those English inventions which tend to
<i>mechanize</i><br>
 other nations. England seems bent on seeing the whole world as
dull as<br>
 itself, and dull in the same way. So this second party is, in
some<br>
 French houses, a happy protest on the part of the old spirit of
our<br>
 light-hearted people. Only, unfortunately, so few houses
protest; and<br>
 the reason is a simple one. If we no longer have many
suppers<br>
 nowadays, it is because never, under any rule, have there been
fewer<br>
 men placed, established, and successful than under the reign of
Louis<br>
 Philippe, when the Revolution began again, lawfully. Everybody
is on<br>
 the march some whither, or trotting at the heels of Fortune.
Time has<br>
 become the costliest commodity, so no one can afford the
lavish<br>
 extravagance of going home to-morrow morning and getting up
late.<br>
 Hence, there is no second soiree now but at the houses of women
rich<br>
 enough to entertain, and since July 1830 such women may be
counted in<br>
 Paris.</p>

<p>In spite of the covert opposition of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, two<br>
 or three women, among them Madame d'Espard and Mademoiselle
des<br>
 Touches, have not chosen to give up the share of influence
they<br>
 exercised in Paris, and have not closed their houses.</p>

<p>The salon of Mademoiselle des Touches is noted in Paris as
being the<br>
 last refuge where the old French wit has found a home, with
its<br>
 reserved depths, its myriad subtle byways, and its exquisite<br>
 politeness. You will there still find grace of manner
notwithstanding<br>
 the conventionalities of courtesy, perfect freedom of talk<br>
 notwithstanding the reserve which is natural to persons of
breeding,<br>
 and, above all, a liberal flow of ideas. No one there thinks
of<br>
 keeping his thought for a play; and no one regards a story as
material<br>
 for a book. In short, the hideous skeleton of literature at bay
never<br>
 stalks there, on the prowl for a clever sally or an
interesting<br>
 subject.</p>

<p><br>
 The memory of one of these evenings especially dwells with me,
less by<br>
 reason of a confidence in which the illustrious de Marsay opened
up<br>
 one of the deepest recesses of woman's heart, than on account of
the<br>
 reflections to which his narrative gave rise, as to the changes
that<br>
 have taken place in the French woman since the fateful
revolution of<br>
 July.</p>

<p>On that evening chance had brought together several persons,
whose<br>
 indisputable merits have won them European reputations. This is
not a<br>
 piece of flattery addressed to France, for there were a good
many<br>
 foreigners present. And, indeed, the men who most shone were not
the<br>
 most famous. Ingenious repartee, acute remarks, admirable
banter,<br>
 pictures sketched with brilliant precision, all sparkled and
flowed<br>
 without elaboration, were poured out without disdain, but
without<br>
 effort, and were exquisitely expressed and delicately
appreciated. The<br>
 men of the world especially were conspicuous for their really
artistic<br>
 grace and spirit.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Europe you will find elegant manners, cordiality,
genial<br>
 fellowship, and knowledge; but only in Paris, in this
drawing-room,<br>
 and those to which I have alluded, does the particular wit
abound<br>
 which gives an agreeable and changeful unity to all these
social<br>
 qualities, an indescribable river-like flow which makes this
profusion<br>
 of ideas, of definitions, of anecdotes, of historical
incidents,<br>
 meander with ease. Paris, the capital of taste, alone possesses
the<br>
 science which makes conversation a tourney in which each type of
wit<br>
 is condensed into a shaft, each speaker utters his phrase and
casts<br>
 his experience in a word, in which every one finds
amusement,<br>
 relaxation, and exercise. Here, then, alone, will you exchange
ideas;<br>
 here you need not, like the dolphin in the fable, carry a monkey
on<br>
 your shoulders; here you will be understood, and will not risk
staking<br>
 your gold pieces against base metal.</p>

<p>Here, again, secrets neatly betrayed, and talk, light or deep,
play<br>
 and eddy, changing their aspect and hue at every phrase.
Eager<br>
 criticism and crisp anecdotes lead on from one to the next. All
eyes<br>
 are listening, a gesture asks a question, and an expressive look
gives<br>
 the answer. In short, and in a word, everything is wit and
mind.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of speech, which, when duly studied and well
handled,<br>
 is the power of the actor and the story-teller, had never so<br>
 completely bewitched me. Nor was I alone under the influence of
its<br>
 spell; we all spent a delightful evening. The conversation had
drifted<br>
 into anecdote, and brought out in its rushing course some
curious<br>
 confessions, several portraits, and a thousand follies, which
make<br>
 this enchanting improvisation impossible to record; still, by
setting<br>
 these things down in all their natural freshness and abruptness,
their<br>
 elusive divarications, you may perhaps feel the charm of a real
French<br>
 evening, taken at the moment when the most engaging familiarity
makes<br>
 each one forget his own interests, his personal conceit, or, if
you<br>
 like, his pretensions.</p>

<p>At about two in the morning, as supper ended, no one was left
sitting<br>
 round the table but intimate friends, proved by intercourse of
fifteen<br>
 years, and some persons of great taste and good breeding, who
knew the<br>
 world. By tacit agreement, perfectly carried out, at supper
every one<br>
 renounced his pretensions to importance. Perfect equality set
the<br>
 tone. But indeed there was no one present who was not very proud
of<br>
 being himself.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle des Touches always insists on her guests
remaining at<br>
 table till they leave, having frequently remarked the change
which a<br>
 move produces in the spirit of a party. Between the dining-room
and<br>
 the drawing-room the charm is destroyed. According to Sterne,
the<br>
 ideas of an author after shaving are different from those he
had<br>
 before. If Sterne is right, may it not be boldly asserted that
the<br>
 frame of mind of a party at table is not the same as that of the
same<br>
 persons returned to the drawing-room? The atmosphere is not
heady, the<br>
 eye no longer contemplates the brilliant disorder of the
dessert, lost<br>
 are the happy effects of that laxness of mood, that benevolence
which<br>
 comes over us while we remain in the humor peculiar to the
well-filled<br>
 man, settled comfortably on one of the springy chairs which are
made<br>
 in these days. Perhaps we are not more ready to talk face to
face with<br>
 the dessert and in the society of good wine, during the
delightful<br>
 interval when every one may sit with an elbow on the table and
his<br>
 head resting on his hand. Not only does every one like to talk
then,<br>
 but also to listen. Digestion, which is almost always attent,
is<br>
 loquacious or silent, as characters differ. Then every one finds
his<br>
 opportunity.</p>

<p>Was not this preamble necessary to make you know the charm of
the<br>
 narrative, by which a celebrated man, now dead, depicted the
innocent<br>
 jesuistry of women, painting it with the subtlety peculiar to
persons<br>
 who have seen much of the world, and which makes statesmen
such<br>
 delightful storytellers when, like Prince Talleyrand and
Prince<br>
 Metternich, they vouchsafe to tell a story?</p>

<p>De Marsay, prime minister for some six months, had already
given<br>
 proofs of superior capabilities. Those who had known him long
were not<br>
 indeed surprised to see him display all the talents and
various<br>
 aptitudes of a statesman; still it might yet be a question
whether he<br>
 would prove to be a solid politician, or had merely been moulded
in<br>
 the fire of circumstance. This question had just been asked by a
man<br>
 whom he had made a prefet, a man of wit and observation, who had
for a<br>
 long time been a journalist, and who admired de Marsay
without<br>
 infusing into his admiration that dash of acrid criticism by
which, in<br>
 Paris, one superior man excuses himself from admiring
another.</p>

<p>"Was there ever," said he, "in your former life, any event,
any<br>
 thought or wish which told you what your vocation was?" asked
Emile<br>
 Blondet; "for we all, like Newton, have our apple, which falls
and<br>
 leads us to the spot where our faculties develop----"</p>

<p>"Yes," said de Marsay; "I will tell you about it."</p>

<p>Pretty women, political dandies, artists, old men, de
Marsay's<br>
 intimate friends,--all settled themselves comfortably, each in
his<br>
 favorite attitude, to look at the Minister. Need it be said that
the<br>
 servants had left, that the doors were shut, and the curtains
drawn<br>
 over them? The silence was so complete that the murmurs of
the<br>
 coachmen's voices could be heard from the courtyard, and the
pawing<br>
 and champing made by horses when asking to be taken back to
their<br>
 stable.</p>

<p>"The statesman, my friends, exists by one single quality,"
said the<br>
 Minister, playing with his gold and mother-of-pearl dessert
knife. "To<br>
 wit: the power of always being master of himself; of profiting
more or<br>
 less, under all circumstances, by every event, however
fortuitous; in<br>
 short, of having within himself a cold and disinterested other
self,<br>
 who looks on as a spectator at all the changes of life, noting
our<br>
 passions and our sentiments, and whispering to us in every case
the<br>
 judgment of a sort of moral ready-reckoner."</p>

<p>"That explains why a statesman is so rare a thing in France,"
said old<br>
 Lord Dudley.</p>

<p>"From a sentimental point of view, this is horrible," the
Minister<br>
 went on. "Hence, when such a phenomenon is seen in a young
man--<br>
 Richelieu, who, when warned overnight by a letter of Concini's
peril,<br>
 slept till midday, when his benefactor was killed at ten
o'clock--or<br>
 say Pitt, or Napoleon, he was a monster. I became such a monster
at a<br>
 very early age, thanks to a woman."</p>

<p>"I fancied," said Madame de Montcornet with a smile, "that
more<br>
 politicians were undone by us than we could make."</p>

<p>"The monster of which I speak is a monster just because he
withstands<br>
 you," replied de Marsay, with a little ironical bow.</p>

<p>"If this is a love-story," the Baronne de Nucingen interposed,
"I<br>
 request that it may not be interrupted by any reflections."</p>

<p>"Reflection is so antipathetic to it!" cried Joseph
Bridau.</p>

<p>"I was seventeen," de Marsay went on; "the Restoration was
being<br>
 consolidated; my old friends know how impetuous and fervid I was
then.<br>
 I was in love for the first time, and I was--I may say so
now--one of<br>
 the handsomest young fellows in Paris. I had youth and good
looks, two<br>
 advantages due to good fortune, but of which we are all as proud
as of<br>
 a conquest. I must be silent as to the rest.--Like all youths, I
was<br>
 in love with a woman six years older than myself. No one of you
here,"<br>
 said he, looking carefully round the table, "can suspect her
name or<br>
 recognize her. Ronquerolles alone, at the time, ever guessed
my<br>
 secret. He had kept it well, but I should have feared his
smile.<br>
 However, he is gone," said the Minister, looking round.</p>

<p>"He would not stay to supper," said Madame de Nucingen.</p>

<p>"For six months, possessed by my passion," de Marsay went on,
"but<br>
 incapable of suspecting that it had overmastered me, I had
abandoned<br>
 myself to that rapturous idolatry which is at once the triumph
and the<br>
 frail joy of the young. I treasured <i>her</i> old gloves; I
drank an<br>
 infusion of the flowers <i>she</i> had worn; I got out of bed at
night to<br>
 go and gaze at <i>her</i> window. All my blood rushed to my
heart when I<br>
 inhaled the perfume she used. I was miles away from knowing that
woman<br>
 is a stove with a marble casing."</p>

<p>"Oh! spare us your terrible verdicts," cried Madame de
Montcornet with<br>
 a smile.</p>

<p>"I believe I should have crushed with my scorn the philosopher
who<br>
 first uttered this terrible but profoundly true thought," said
de<br>
 Marsay. "You are all far too keen-sighted for me to say any more
on<br>
 that point. These few words will remind you of your own
follies.</p>

<p>"A great lady if ever there was one, a widow without
children--oh! all<br>
 was perfect--my idol would shut herself up to mark my linen with
her<br>
 hair; in short, she responded to my madness by her own. And how
can we<br>
 fail to believe in passion when it has the guarantee of
madness?</p>

<p>"We each devoted all our minds to concealing a love so perfect
and so<br>
 beautiful from the eyes of the world; and we succeeded. And what
charm<br>
 we found in our escapades! Of her I will say nothing. She
was<br>
 perfection then, and to this day is considered one of the
most<br>
 beautiful women in Paris; but at that time a man would have
endured<br>
 death to win one of her glances. She had been left with an
amount of<br>
 fortune sufficient for a woman who had loved and was adored; but
the<br>
 Restoration, to which she owed renewed lustre, made it seem
inadequate<br>
 in comparison with her name. In my position I was so fatuous as
never<br>
 to dream of a suspicion. Though my jealousy would have been of
a<br>
 hundred and twenty Othello-power, that terrible passion
slumbered in<br>
 me as gold in the nugget. I would have ordered my servant to
thrash me<br>
 if I had been so base as ever to doubt the purity of that
angel--so<br>
 fragile and so strong, so fair, so artless, pure, spotless, and
whose<br>
 blue eyes allowed my gaze to sound it to the very depths of her
heart<br>
 with adorable submissiveness. Never was there the slightest
hesitancy<br>
 in her attitude, her look, or word; always white and fresh, and
ready<br>
 for the Beloved like the Oriental Lily of the 'Song of Songs!'
Ah! my<br>
 friends!" sadly exclaimed the Minister, grown young again, "a
man must<br>
 hit his head very hard on the marble to dispel that poem!"</p>

<p><br>
 This cry of nature, finding an echo in the listeners, spurred
the<br>
 curiosity he had excited in them with so much skill.</p>

<p>"Every morning, riding Sultan--the fine horse you sent me
from<br>
 England," de Marsay went on, addressing Lord Dudley, "I rode
past her<br>
 open carriage, the horses' pace being intentionally reduced to a
walk,<br>
 and read the order of the day signaled to me by the flowers of
her<br>
 bouquet in case we were unable to exchange a few words. Though
we saw<br>
 each other almost every evening in society, and she wrote to me
every<br>
 day, to deceive the curious and mislead the observant we had
adopted a<br>
 scheme of conduct: never to look at each other; to avoid
meeting; to<br>
 speak ill of each other. Self-admiration, swagger, or playing
the<br>
 disdained swain,--all these old manoeuvres are not to compare
on<br>
 either part with a false passion professed for an indifferent
person<br>
 and an air of indifference towards the true idol. If two lovers
will<br>
 only play that game, the world will always be deceived; but then
they<br>
 must be very secure of each other.</p>

<p>"Her stalking-horse was a man in high favor, a courtier, cold
and<br>
 sanctimonious, whom she never received at her own house. This
little<br>
 comedy was performed for the benefit of simpletons and
drawing-room<br>
 circles, who laughed at it. Marriage was never spoken of between
us;<br>
 six years' difference of age might give her pause; she knew
nothing of<br>
 my fortune, of which, on principle, I have always kept the
secret. I,<br>
 on my part, fascinated by her wit and manners, by the extent of
her<br>
 knowledge and her experience of the world, would have married
her<br>
 without a thought. At the same time, her reserve charmed me. If
she<br>
 had been the first to speak of marriage in a certain tone, I
might<br>
 perhaps have noted it as vulgar in that accomplished soul.</p>

<p>"Six months, full and perfect--a diamond of the purest water!
That has<br>
 been my portion of love in this base world.</p>

<p>"One morning, attacked by the feverish stiffness which marks
the<br>
 beginning of a cold, I wrote her a line to put off one of those
secret<br>
 festivals which are buried under the roofs of Paris like pearls
in the<br>
 sea. No sooner was the letter sent than remorse seized me: she
will<br>
 not believe that I am ill! thought I. She was wont to affect
jealousy<br>
 and suspiciousness.--When jealousy is genuine," said de
Marsay,<br>
 interrupting himself, "it is the visible sign of an unique
passion."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Princesse de Cadignan eagerly.</p>

<p>"Unique and true love," said de Marsay, "produces a sort of
corporeal<br>
 apathy attuned to the contemplation into which one falls. Then
the<br>
 mind complicates everything; it works on itself, pictures its
fancies,<br>
 turns them into reality and torment; and such jealousy is as<br>
 delightful as it is distressing."</p>

<p>A foreign minister smiled as, by the light of memory, he felt
the<br>
 truth of this remark.</p>

<p>"Besides," de Marsay went on, "I said to myself, why miss a
happy<br>
 hour? Was it not better to go, even though feverish? And, then,
if she<br>
 learns that I am ill, I believe her capable of hurrying here
and<br>
 compromising herself. I made an effort; I wrote a second letter,
and<br>
 carried it myself, for my confidential servant was now gone. The
river<br>
 lay between us. I had to cross Paris; but at last, within a
suitable<br>
 distance of her house, I caught sight of a messenger; I charged
him to<br>
 have the note sent up to her at once, and I had the happy idea
of<br>
 driving past her door in a hackney cab to see whether she might
not by<br>
 chance receive the two letters together. At the moment when I
arrived<br>
 it was two o'clock; the great gate opened to admit a carriage.
Whose?<br>
 --That of the stalking-horse!</p>

<p>"It is fifteen years since--well, even while I tell the tale,
I, the<br>
 exhausted orator, the Minister dried up by the friction of
public<br>
 business, I still feel a surging in my heart and the hot blood
about<br>
 my diaphragm. At the end of an hour I passed once more; the
carriage<br>
 was still in the courtyard! My note no doubt was in the
porter's<br>
 hands. At last, at half-past three, the carriage drove out. I
could<br>
 observe my rival's expression; he was grave, and did not smile;
but he<br>
 was in love, and no doubt there was business in hand.</p>

<p>"I went to keep my appointment; the queen of my heart met me;
I saw<br>
 her calm, pure, serene. And here I must confess that I have
always<br>
 thought that Othello was not only stupid, but showed very bad
taste.<br>
 Only a man who is half a Negro could behave so: indeed
Shakespeare<br>
 felt this when he called his play 'The Moor of Venice.' The
sight of<br>
 the woman we love is such a balm to the heart that it must
dispel<br>
 anguish, doubt, and sorrow. All my rage vanished. I could smile
again.<br>
 Hence this cheerfulness, which at my age now would be the
most<br>
 atrocious dissimulation, was the result of my youth and my love.
My<br>
 jealousy once buried, I had the power of observation. My
ailing<br>
 condition was evident; the horrible doubts that had fermented in
me<br>
 increased it. At last I found an opening for putting in these
words:<br>
 'You have had no one with you this morning?' making a pretext of
the<br>
 uneasiness I had felt in the fear lest she should have disposed
of her<br>
 time after receiving my first note.--'Ah!' she exclaimed, 'only
a man<br>
 could have such ideas! As if I could think of anything but
your<br>
 suffering. Till the moment when I received your second note I
could<br>
 think only of how I could contrive to see you.'--'And you
were<br>
 alone?'--'Alone,' said she, looking at me with a face of
innocence so<br>
 perfect that it must have been his distrust of such a look as
that<br>
 which made the Moor kill Desdemona. As she lived alone in the
house,<br>
 the word was a fearful lie. One single lie destroys the
absolute<br>
 confidence which to some souls is the very foundation of
happiness.</p>

<p>"To explain to you what passed in me at that moment it must be
assumed<br>
 that we have an internal self of which the exterior <i>I</i> is
but the<br>
 husk; that this self, as brilliant as light, is as fragile as a
shade<br>
 --well, that beautiful self was in me thenceforth for ever
shrouded in<br>
 crape. Yes; I felt a cold and fleshless hand cast over me the
winding-<br>
 sheet of experience, dooming me to the eternal mourning into
which the<br>
 first betrayal plunges the soul. As I cast my eyes down that she
might<br>
 not observe my dizziness, this proud thought somewhat restored
my<br>
 strength: 'If she is deceiving you, she is unworthy of you!'</p>

<p>"I ascribed my sudden reddening and the tears which started to
my eyes<br>
 to an attack of pain, and the sweet creature insisted on driving
me<br>
 home with the blinds of the cab drawn. On the way she was full
of a<br>
 solicitude and tenderness that might have deceived the Moor of
Venice<br>
 whom I have taken as a standard of comparison. Indeed, if that
great<br>
 child were to hesitate two seconds longer, every intelligent
spectator<br>
 feels that he would ask Desdemona's forgiveness. Thus, killing
the<br>
 woman is the act of a boy.--She wept as we parted, so much was
she<br>
 distressed at being unable to nurse me herself. She wished she
were my<br>
 valet, in whose happiness she found a cause of envy, and all
this was<br>
 as elegantly expressed, oh! as Clarissa might have written in
her<br>
 happiness. There is always a precious ape in the prettiest and
most<br>
 angelic woman!"</p>

<p>At these words all the women looked down, as if hurt by this
brutal<br>
 truth so brutally stated.</p>

<p>"I will say nothing of the night, nor of the week I spent," de
Marsay<br>
 went on. "I discovered that I was a statesman."</p>

<p>It was so well said that we all uttered an admiring
exclamation.</p>

<p>"As I thought over the really cruel vengeance to be taken on a
woman,"<br>
 said de Marsay, continuing his story, "with infernal
ingenuity--for,<br>
 as we had loved each other, some terrible and irreparable
revenges<br>
 were possible--I despised myself, I felt how common I was, I<br>
 insensibly formulated a horrible code--that of Indulgence. In
taking<br>
 vengeance on a woman, do we not in fact admit that there is but
one<br>
 for us, that we cannot do without her? And, then, is revenge the
way<br>
 to win her back? If she is not indispensable, if there are other
women<br>
 in the world, why not grant her the right to change which we
assume?</p>

<p>"This, of course, applies only to passion; in any other sense
it would<br>
 be socially wrong. Nothing more clearly proves the necessity
for<br>
 indissoluble marriage than the instability of passion. The two
sexes<br>
 must be chained up, like wild beasts as they are, by inevitable
law,<br>
 deaf and mute. Eliminate revenge, and infidelity in love is
nothing.<br>
 Those who believe that for them there is but one woman in the
world<br>
 must be in favor of vengeance, and then there is but one form of
it--<br>
 that of Othello.</p>

<p>"Mine was different."</p>

<p>The words produced in each of us the imperceptible movement
which<br>
 newspaper writers represent in Parliamentary reports by the
words:<br>
 <i>great sensation</i>.</p>

<p>"Cured of my cold, and of my pure, absolute, divine love, I
flung<br>
 myself into an adventure, of which the heroine was charming, and
of a<br>
 style of beauty utterly opposed to that of my deceiving angel. I
took<br>
 care not to quarrel with this clever woman, who was so good
an<br>
 actress, for I doubt whether true love can give such gracious
delights<br>
 as those lavished by such a dexterous fraud. Such refined
hypocrisy is<br>
 as good as virtue.--I am not speaking to you Englishwomen, my
lady,"<br>
 said the Minister, suavely, addressing Lady Barimore, Lord
Dudley's<br>
 daughter. "I tried to be the same lover.</p>

<p>"I wished to have some of my hair worked up for my new angel,
and I<br>
 went to a skilled artist who at that time dwelt in the Rue
Boucher.<br>
 The man had a monopoly of capillary keepsakes, and I mention
his<br>
 address for the benefit of those who have not much hair; he has
plenty<br>
 of every kind and every color. After I had explained my order,
he<br>
 showed me his work. I then saw achievements of patience
surpassing<br>
 those which the story books ascribe to fairies, or which are
executed<br>
 by prisoners. He brought me up to date as to the caprices and
fashions<br>
 governing the use of hair. 'For the last year,' said he, 'there
has<br>
 been a rage for marking linen with hair; happily I had a
fine<br>
 collection of hair and skilled needlewomen,'--on hearing this
a<br>
 suspicion flashed upon me; I took out my handkerchief and said,
'So<br>
 this was done in your shop, with false hair?'--He looked at
the<br>
 handkerchief, and said, 'Ay! that lady was very particular,
she<br>
 insisted on verifying the tint of the hair. My wife herself
marked<br>
 those handkerchiefs. You have there, sir, one of the finest
pieces of<br>
 work we have ever executed.' Before this last ray of light I
might<br>
 have believed something--might have taken a woman's word. I left
the<br>
 shop still having faith in pleasure, but where love was
concerned I<br>
 was as atheistical as a mathematician.</p>

<p>"Two months later I was sitting by the side of the ethereal
being in<br>
 her boudoir, on her sofa; I was holding one of her hands--they
were<br>
 very beautiful--and we scaled the Alps of sentiment, culling
their<br>
 sweetest flowers, and pulling off the daisy-petals; there is
always a<br>
 moment when one pulls daisies to pieces, even if it is in a
drawing-<br>
 room and there are no daisies. At the intensest moment of
tenderness,<br>
 and when we are most in love, love is so well aware of its own
short<br>
 duration that we are irresistibly urged to ask, 'Do you love me?
Will<br>
 you love me always?' I seized the elegiac moment, so warm, so
flowery,<br>
 so full-blown, to lead her to tell her most delightful lies, in
the<br>
 enchanting language of love. Charlotte displayed her
choicest<br>
 allurements: She could not live without me; I was to her the
only man<br>
 in the world; she feared to weary me, because my presence bereft
her<br>
 of all her wits; with me, all her faculties were lost in love;
she was<br>
 indeed too tender to escape alarms; for the last six months she
had<br>
 been seeking some way to bind me to her eternally, and God alone
knew<br>
 that secret; in short, I was her god!"</p>

<p>The women who heard de Marsay seemed offended by seeing
themselves so<br>
 well acted, for he seconded the words by airs, and sidelong
attitudes,<br>
 and mincing grimaces which were quite illusory.</p>

<p>"At the very moment when I might have believed these
adorable<br>
 falsehoods, as I still held her right hand in mine, I said to
her,<br>
 'When are you to marry the Duke?'</p>

<p>"The thrust was so direct, my gaze met hers so boldly, and her
hand<br>
 lay so tightly in mine, that her start, slight as it was, could
not be<br>
 disguised; her eyes fell before mine, and a faint blush colored
her<br>
 cheeks.--'The Duke! What do you mean?' she said, affecting
great<br>
 astonishment.--'I know everything,' replied I; 'and in my
opinion, you<br>
 should delay no longer; he is rich; he is a duke; but he is more
than<br>
 devout, he is religious! I am sure, therefore, that you have
been<br>
 faithful to me, thanks to his scruples. You cannot imagine
how<br>
 urgently necessary it is that you should compromise him with
himself<br>
 and with God; short of that you will never bring him to the
point.'--<br>
 'Is this a dream?' said she, pushing her hair from her
forehead,<br>
 fifteen years before Malibran, with the gesture which Malibran
has<br>
 made so famous.--'Come, do not be childish, my angel,' said I,
trying<br>
 to take her hands; but she folded them before her with a
little<br>
 prudish and indignant mein.--'Marry him, you have my
permission,' said<br>
 I, replying to this gesture by using the formal <i>vous</i>
instead of<br>
 <i>tu</i>. 'Nay, better, I beg you to do so.'--'But,' cried she,
falling at<br>
 my knees, 'there is some horrible mistake; I love no one in the
world<br>
 but you; you may demand any proofs you please.'--'Rise, my
dear,' said<br>
 I, 'and do me the honor of being truthful.'--'As before
God.'--'Do you<br>
 doubt my love?'--'No.'--'Nor my fidelity?'--'No.'--'Well, I
have<br>
 committed the greatest crime,' I went on. 'I have doubted your
love<br>
 and your fidelity. Between two intoxications I looked calmly
about<br>
 me.'--'Calmly!' sighed she. 'That is enough, Henri; you no
longer love<br>
 me.'</p>

<br>
"She had at once found, you perceive, a loophole for escape. In
scenes<br>
like these an adverb is dangerous. But, happily, curiosity made
her<br>
add: 'And what did you see? Have I ever spoken of the Duke
excepting<br>
in public? Have you detected in my eyes----?'--'No,' said I, 'but
in<br>
his. And you have eight times made me go to Saint-Thomas d'Aquin
to<br>
see you listening to the same mass as he.'--'Ah!' she exclaimed,
'then<br>
I have made you jealous!'--Oh! I only wish I could be!' said
I,<br>
admiring the pliancy of her quick intelligence, and these
acrobatic<br>
feats which can only be successful in the eyes of the blind. 'But
by<br>
dint of going to church I have become very incredulous. On the
day of<br>
my first cold, and your first treachery, when you thought I was
in<br>
bed, you received the Duke, and you told me you had seen no
one.'--'Do<br>
you know that your conduct is infamous?'--'In what respect? I
consider<br>
your marriage to the Duke an excellent arrangement; he gives you
a<br>
great name, the only rank that suits you, a brilliant and<br>
distinguished position. You will be one of the queens of Paris.
I<br>
should be doing you a wrong if I placed any obstacle in the way
of<br>
this prospect, this distinguished life, this splendid alliance.
Ah!<br>
Charlotte, some day you will do me justice by discovering how
unlike<br>
my character is to that of other young men. You would have
been<br>
compelled to deceive me; yes, you would have found it very
difficult<br>
to break with me, for he watches you. It is time that we should
part,<br>
for the Duke is rigidly virtuous. You must turn prude; I advise
you to<br>
do so. The Duke is vain; he will be proud of his wife.'--'Oh!'
cried<br>
she, bursting into tears, 'Henri, if only you had spoken! Yes, if
you<br>
had chosen'--it was I who was to blame, you understand--'we would
have<br>
gone to live all our days in a corner, married, happy, and defied
the<br>
world.'--'Well, it is too late now,' said I, kissing her hands,
and<br>
putting on a victimized air.--'Good God! But I can undo it all!'
said<br>
she.--'No, you have gone too far with the Duke. I ought indeed to
go a<br>
journey to part us more effectually. We should both have reason
to<br>
fear our own affection----'--'Henri, do you think the Duke has
any<br>
suspicions?' I was still 'Henri,' but the <i>tu</i> was lost for
ever.--'I<br>
do not think so,' I replied, assuming the manner of a friend;
'but be<br>
as devout as possible, reconcile yourself to God, for the Duke
waits<br>
for proofs; he hesitates, you must bring him to the point.'

<p>"She rose, and walked twice round the boudoir in real or
affected<br>
 agitation; then she no doubt found an attitude and a look
beseeming<br>
 the new state of affairs, for she stopped in front of me, held
out her<br>
 hand, and said in a voice broken by emotion, 'Well, Henri, you
are<br>
 loyal, noble, and a charming man; I shall never forget you.'</p>

<p>"These were admirable tactics. She was bewitching in this
transition<br>
 of feeling, indispensable to the situation in which she wished
to<br>
 place herself in regard to me. I fell into the attitude, the
manners,<br>
 and the look of a man so deeply distressed, that I saw her too
newly<br>
 assumed dignity giving way; she looked at me, took my hand, drew
me<br>
 along almost, threw me on the sofa, but quite gently, and said
after a<br>
 moment's silence, 'I am dreadfully unhappy, my dear fellow. Do
you<br>
 love me?'--'Oh! yes.'--'Well, then, what will become of you?'
"</p>

<p>At this point the women all looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Though I can still suffer when I recall her perfidy, I still
laugh at<br>
 her expression of entire conviction and sweet satisfaction that
I must<br>
 die, or at any rate sink into perpetual melancholy," de Marsay
went<br>
 on. "Oh! do not laugh yet!" he said to his listeners; "there is
better<br>
 to come. I looked at her very tenderly after a pause, and said
to her,<br>
 'Yes, that is what I have been wondering.'--'Well, what will you
do?'<br>
 --'I asked myself that the day after my cold.'--'And----?' she
asked<br>
 with eager anxiety.--'And I have made advances to the little
lady to<br>
 whom I was supposed to be attached.'</p>

<p>"Charlotte started up from the sofa like a frightened doe,
trembling<br>
 like a leaf, gave me one of those looks in which women forgo all
their<br>
 dignity, all their modesty, their refinement, and even their
grace,<br>
 the sparkling glitter of a hunted viper's eye when driven into
a<br>
 corner, and said, 'And I have loved this man! I have struggled!
I<br>
 have----' On this last thought, which I leave you to guess, she
made<br>
 the most impressive pause I ever heard.--'Good God!' she cried,
'how<br>
 unhappy are we women! we never can be loved. To you there is
nothing<br>
 serious in the purest feelings. But never mind; when you cheat
us you<br>
 still are our dupes!'--'I see that plainly,' said I, with a
stricken<br>
 air; 'you have far too much wit in your anger for your heart to
suffer<br>
 from it.'--This modest epigram increased her rage; she found
some<br>
 tears of vexation. 'You disgust me with the world and with
life.' she<br>
 said; 'you snatch away all my illusions; you deprave my
heart.'</p>

<p>"She said to me all that I had a right to say to her, and with
a<br>
 simple effrontery, an artless audacity, which would certainly
have<br>
 nailed any man but me on the spot.--'What is to become of us
poor<br>
 women in a state of society such as Louis XVIII.'s charter made
it?'--<br>
 (Imagine how her words had run away with her.)--'Yes, indeed, we
are<br>
 born to suffer. In matters of passion we are always superior to
you,<br>
 and you are beneath all loyalty. There is no honesty in your
hearts.<br>
 To you love is a game in which you always cheat.'--'My dear,'
said I,<br>
 'to take anything serious in society nowadays would be like
making<br>
 romantic love to an actress.'--'What a shameless betrayal! It
was<br>
 deliberately planned!'--'No, only a rational
issue.'--'Good-bye,<br>
 Monsieur de Marsay,' said she; 'you have deceived me
horribly.'--<br>
 'Surely,' I replied, taking up a submissive attitude, 'Madame
la<br>
 Duchesse will not remember Charlotte's
grievances?'--'Certainly,' she<br>
 answered bitterly.--'Then, in fact, you hate me?'--She bowed,
and I<br>
 said to myself, 'There is something still left!'</p>

<p>"The feeling she had when I parted from her allowed her to
believe<br>
 that she still had something to avenge. Well, my friends, I
have<br>
 carefully studied the lives of men who have had great success
with<br>
 women, but I do not believe that the Marechal de Richelieu, or
Lauzun,<br>
 or Louis de Valois ever effected a more judicious retreat at the
first<br>
 attempt. As to my mind and heart, they were cast in a mould then
and<br>
 there, once for all, and the power of control I thus acquired
over the<br>
 thoughtless impulses which make us commit so many follies gained
me<br>
 the admirable presence of mind you all know."</p>

<p>"How deeply I pity the second!" exclaimed the Baronne de
Nucingen.</p>

<p>A scarcely perceptible smile on de Marsay's pale lips made
Delphine de<br>
 Nucingen color.</p>

<p>"How we do forget!" said the Baron de Nucingen.</p>

<p>The great banker's simplicity was so extremely droll, that his
wife,<br>
 who was de Marsay's "second," could not help laughing like every
one<br>
 else.</p>

<p>"You are all ready to condemn the woman," said Lady Dudley.
"Well, I<br>
 quite understand that she did not regard her marriage as an act
of<br>
 inconstancy. Men will never distinguish between constancy
and<br>
 fidelity.--I know the woman whose story Monsieur de Marsay has
told<br>
 us, and she is one of the last of your truly great ladies."</p>

<p>"Alas! my lady, you are right," replied de Marsay. "For very
nearly<br>
 fifty years we have been looking on at the progressive ruin of
all<br>
 social distinctions. We ought to have saved our women from this
great<br>
 wreck, but the Civil Code has swept its leveling influence over
their<br>
 heads. However terrible the words, they must be spoken:
Duchesses are<br>
 vanishing, and marquises too! As to the baronesses--I must
apologize<br>
 to Madame de Nucingen, who will become a countess when her
husband is<br>
 made a peer of France--baronesses have never succeeded in
getting<br>
 people to take them seriously."</p>

<p>"Aristocracy begins with the viscountess," said Blondet with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Countesses will survive," said de Marsay. "An elegant woman
will be<br>
 more or less of a countess--a countess of the Empire or of
yesterday,<br>
 a countess of the old block, or, as they say in Italy, a
countess by<br>
 courtesy. But as to the great lady, she died out with the
dignified<br>
 splendor of the last century, with powder, patches,
high-heeled<br>
 slippers, and stiff bodices with a delta stomacher of bows.
Duchesses<br>
 in these days can pass through a door without any need to widen
it for<br>
 their hoops. The Empire saw the last of gowns with trains! I am
still<br>
 puzzled to understand how a sovereign who wished to see his
drawing-<br>
 room swept by ducal satin and velvet did not make indestructible
laws.<br>
 Napoleon never guessed the results of the Code he was so proud
of.<br>
 That man, by creating duchesses, founded the race of our
'ladies' of<br>
 to-day--the indirect offspring of his legislation."</p>

<p>"It was logic, handled as a hammer by boys just out of school
and by<br>
 obscure journalists, which demolished the splendors of the
social<br>
 state," said the Comte de Vandenesse. "In these days every rogue
who<br>
 can hold his head straight in his collar, cover his manly bosom
with<br>
 half an ell of satin by way of a cuirass, display a brow
where<br>
 apocryphal genius gleams under curling locks, and strut in a
pair of<br>
 patent-leather pumps graced by silk socks which cost six
francs,<br>
 screws his eye-glass into one of his eye-sockets by puckering up
his<br>
 cheek, and whether he be an attorney's clerk, a contractor's
son, or a<br>
 banker's bastard, he stares impertinently at the prettiest
duchess,<br>
 appraises her as she walks downstairs, and says to his
friend--dressed<br>
 by Buisson, as we all are, and mounted in patent-leather like
any duke<br>
 himself--'There, my boy, that is a perfect lady.' "</p>

<p>"You have not known how to form a party," said Lord Dudley;
"it will<br>
 be a long time yet before you have a policy. You talk a great
deal in<br>
 France about organizing labor, and you have not yet
organized<br>
 property. So this is what happens: Any duke--and even in the
time of<br>
 Louis XVIII. and Charles X. there were some left who had two
hundred<br>
 thousand francs a year, a magnificent residence, and a sumptuous
train<br>
 of servants--well, such a duke could live like a great lord. The
last<br>
 of these great gentlemen in France was the Prince de
Talleyrand.--This<br>
 duke leaves four children, two of them girls. Granting that he
has<br>
 great luck in marrying them all well, each of these descendants
will<br>
 have but sixty or eighty thousand francs a year now; each is
the<br>
 father or mother of children, and consequently obliged to live
with<br>
 the strictest economy in a flat on the ground floor or first
floor of<br>
 a large house. Who knows if they may not even be hunting a
fortune?<br>
 Henceforth the eldest son's wife, a duchess in name only, has
no<br>
 carriage, no people, no opera-box, no time to herself. She has
not her<br>
 own rooms in the family mansion, nor her fortune, nor her pretty
toys;<br>
 she is buried in trade; she buys socks for her dear little
children,<br>
 nurses them herself, and keeps an eye on her girls, whom she no
longer<br>
 sends to school at a convent. Thus your noblest dames have been
turned<br>
 into worthy brood-hens."</p>

<p>"Alas! it is true," said Joseph Bridau. "In our day we cannot
show<br>
 those beautiful flowers of womanhood which graced the golden
ages of<br>
 the French Monarchy. The great lady's fan is broken. A woman
has<br>
 nothing now to blush for; she need not slander or whisper, hide
her<br>
 face or reveal it. A fan is of no use now but for fanning
herself.<br>
 When once a thing is no more than what it is, it is too useful
to be a<br>
 form of luxury."</p>

<p>"Everything in France has aided and abetted the 'perfect
lady,' " said<br>
 Daniel d'Arthez. "The aristocracy has acknowledged her by
retreating<br>
 to the recesses of its landed estates, where it has hidden
itself to<br>
 die--emigrating inland before the march of ideas, as of old to
foreign<br>
 lands before that of the masses. The women who could have
founded<br>
 European <i>salons</i>, could have guided opinion and turned it
inside out<br>
 like a glove, could have ruled the world by ruling the men of
art or<br>
 of intellect who ought to have ruled it, have committed the
blunder of<br>
 abandoning their ground; they were ashamed of having to fight
against<br>
 the citizen class drunk with power, and rushing out on to the
stage of<br>
 the world, there to be cut to pieces perhaps by the barbarians
who are<br>
 at its heels. Hence, where the middle class insist on seeing<br>
 princesses, these are really only ladylike young women. In these
days<br>
 princes can find no great ladies whom they may compromise; they
cannot<br>
 even confer honor on a woman taken up at random. The Duc de
Bourbon<br>
 was the last prince to avail himself of this privilege."</p>

<p>"And God alone knows how dearly he paid for it," said Lord
Dudley.</p>

<p>"Nowadays princes have lady-like wives, obliged to share their
opera-<br>
 box with other ladies; royal favor could not raise them higher
by a<br>
 hair's breadth; they glide unremarkable between the waters of
the<br>
 citizen class and those of the nobility--not altogether noble
nor<br>
 altogether <i>bourgeoises</i>," said the Marquise de Rochegude
acridly.</p>

<p>"The press has fallen heir to the Woman," exclaimed Rastignac.
"She no<br>
 longer has the quality of a spoken <i>feuilleton</i>--delightful
calumnies<br>
 graced by elegant language. We read <i>feuilletons</i> written
in a dialect<br>
 which changes every three years, society papers about as
mirthful as<br>
 an undertaker's mute, and as light as the lead of their type.
French<br>
 conversation is carried on from one end of the country to the
other in<br>
 a revolutionary jargon, through long columns of type printed in
old<br>
 mansions where a press groans in the place where formerly
elegant<br>
 company used to meet."</p>

<p>"The knell of the highest society is tolling," said a Russian
Prince.<br>
 "Do you hear it? And the first stroke is your modern word
<i>lady</i>."</p>

<p>"You are right, Prince," said de Marsay. "The 'perfect lady,'
issuing<br>
 from the ranks of the nobility, or sprouting from the citizen
class,<br>
 and the product of every soil, even of the provinces is the
expression<br>
 of these times, a last remaining embodiment of good taste,
grace, wit,<br>
 and distinction, all combined, but dwarfed. We shall see no more
great<br>
 ladies in France, but there will be 'ladies' for a long time,
elected<br>
 by public opinion to form an upper chamber of women, and who
will be<br>
 among the fair sex what a 'gentleman' is in England."</p>

<p>"And that they call progress!" exclaimed Mademoiselle des
Touches. "I<br>
 should like to know where the progress lies?"</p>

<p>"Why, in this," said Madame de Nucingen. "Formerly a woman
might have<br>
 the voice of a fish-seller, the walk of a grenadier, the face of
an<br>
 impudent courtesan, her hair too high on her forehead, a large
foot, a<br>
 thick hand--she was a great lady in spite of it all; but in
these<br>
 days, even if she were a Montmorency--if a Montmorency would
ever be<br>
 such a creature--she would not be a lady."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean by a 'perfect lady'?" asked Count Adam
Laginski.</p>

<p>"She is a modern product, a deplorable triumph of the elective
system<br>
 as applied to the fair sex," said the Minister. "Every
revolution has<br>
 a word of its own which epitomizes and depicts it."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the Russian, who had come to make a
literary<br>
 reputation in Paris. "The explanation of certain words added
from time<br>
 to time to your beautiful language would make a magnificent
history.<br>
 <i>Organize</i>, for instance, is the word of the Empire, and
sums up<br>
 Napoleon completely."</p>

<p>"But all that does not explain what is meant by a lady!" the
young<br>
 Pole exclaimed, with some impatience.</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you," said Emile Blondet to Count Adam.
"One fine<br>
 morning you go for a saunter in Paris. It is past two, but five
has<br>
 not yet struck. You see a woman coming towards you; your first
glance<br>
 at her is like the preface to a good book, it leads you to
expect a<br>
 world of elegance and refinement. Like a botanist over hill and
dale<br>
 in his pursuit of plants, among the vulgarities of Paris life
you have<br>
 at last found a rare flower. This woman is attended by two
very<br>
 distinguished-looking men, of whom one, at any rate, wears an
order;<br>
 or else a servant out of livery follows her at a distance of
ten<br>
 yards. She displays no gaudy colors, no open-worked stockings,
no<br>
 over-elaborate waist-buckle, no embroidered frills to her
drawers<br>
 fussing round her ankles. You will see that she is shod with
prunella<br>
 shoes, with sandals crossed over extremely fine cotton
stockings, or<br>
 plain gray silk stockings; or perhaps she wears boots of the
most<br>
 exquisite simplicity. You notice that her gown is made of a neat
and<br>
 inexpensive material, but made in a way that surprises more than
one<br>
 woman of the middle class; it is almost always a long pelisse,
with<br>
 bows to fasten it, and neatly bound with fine cord or an
imperceptible<br>
 braid. The Unknown has a way of her own in wrapping herself in
her<br>
 shawl or mantilla; she knows how to draw it round her from her
hips to<br>
 her neck, outlining a carapace, as it were, which would make
an<br>
 ordinary woman look like a turtle, but which in her sets off the
most<br>
 beautiful forms while concealing them. How does she do it? This
secret<br>
 she keeps, though unguarded by any patent.</p>

<br>
"As she walks she gives herself a little concentric and
harmonious<br>
twist, which makes her supple or dangerous slenderness writhe
under<br>
the stuff, as a snake does under the green gauze of trembling
grass.<br>
Is it to an angel or a devil that she owes the graceful
undulation<br>
which plays under her long black silk cape, stirs its lace
frill,<br>
sheds an airy balm, and what I should like to call the breeze of
a<br>
Parisienne? You may recognize over her arms, round her waist,
about<br>
her throat, a science of drapery recalling the antique Mnemosyne.


<p>"Oh! how thoroughly she understands the <i>cut</i> of her
gait--forgive the<br>
 expression. Study the way she puts her foot forward moulding her
skirt<br>
 with such a decent preciseness that the passer-by is filled
with<br>
 admiration, mingled with desire, but subdued by deep respect.
When an<br>
 Englishwoman attempts this step, she looks like a grenadier
marching<br>
 forward to attack a redoubt. The women of Paris have a genius
for<br>
 walking. The municipality really owed them asphalt
footwalks.</p>

<p>"Our Unknown jostles no one. If she wants to pass, she waits
with<br>
 proud humility till some one makes way. The distinction peculiar
to a<br>
 well-bred woman betrays itself, especially in the way she holds
her<br>
 shawl or cloak crossed over her bosom. Even as she walks she has
a<br>
 little air of serene dignity, like Raphael's Madonnas in their
frames.<br>
 Her aspect, at once quiet and disdainful, makes the most
insolent<br>
 dandy step aside for her.</p>

<p>"Her bonnet, remarkable for its simplicity, is trimmed with
crisp<br>
 ribbons; there may be flowers in it, but the cleverest of such
women<br>
 wear only bows. Feathers demand a carriage; flowers are too
showy.<br>
 Beneath it you see the fresh unworn face of a woman who,
without<br>
 conceit, is sure of herself; who looks at nothing, and sees<br>
 everything; whose vanity, satiated by being constantly
gratified,<br>
 stamps her face with an indifference which piques your
curiosity. She<br>
 knows that she is looked at, she knows that everybody, even
women,<br>
 turn round to see her again. And she threads her way through
Paris<br>
 like a gossamer, spotless and pure.</p>

<p>"This delightful species affects the hottest latitudes, the
cleanest<br>
 longitudes of Paris; you will meet her between the 10th and
110th<br>
 Arcade of the Rue de Rivoli; along the line of the Boulevards
from the<br>
 equator of the Passage des Panoramas, where the products of
India<br>
 flourish, where the warmest creations of industry are displayed,
to<br>
 the Cape of the Madeleine; in the least muddy districts of the
citizen<br>
 quarters, between No. 30 and No. 130 of the Rue du Faubourg
Saint-<br>
 Honore. During the winter, she haunts the terrace of the
Feuillants,<br>
 but not the asphalt pavement that lies parallel. According to
the<br>
 weather, she may be seen flying in the Avenue of the
Champs-Elysees,<br>
 which is bounded on the east by the Place Louis XV., on the west
by<br>
 the Avenue de Marigny, to the south by the road, to the north by
the<br>
 gardens of the Faubourg Saint-Honore. Never is this pretty
variety of<br>
 woman to be seen in the hyperborean regions of the Rue
Saint-Denis,<br>
 never in the Kamtschatka of miry, narrow, commercial streets,
never<br>
 anywhere in bad weather. These flowers of Paris, blooming only
in<br>
 Oriental weather, perfume the highways; and after five o'clock
fold up<br>
 like morning-glory flowers. The women you will see later,
looking a<br>
 little like them, are would-be ladies; while the fair Unknown,
your<br>
 Beatrice of a day, is a 'perfect lady.'</p>

<p>"It is not very easy for a foreigner, my dear Count, to
recognize the<br>
 differences by which the observer <i>emeritus</i> distinguishes
them--women<br>
 are such consummate actresses; but they are glaring in the eyes
of<br>
 Parisians: hooks ill fastened, strings showing loops of
rusty-white<br>
 tape through a gaping slit in the back, rubbed shoe-leather,
ironed<br>
 bonnet-strings, an over-full skirt, an over-tight waist. You
will see<br>
 a certain effort in the intentional droop of the eyelid. There
is<br>
 something conventional in the attitude.</p>

<p>"As to the <i>bourgeoise</i>, the citizen womankind, she
cannot possibly be<br>
 mistaken for the spell cast over you by the Unknown. She is
bustling,<br>
 and goes out in all weathers, trots about, comes, goes, gazes,
does<br>
 not know whether she will or will not go into a shop. Where the
lady<br>
 knows just what she wants and what she is doing, the townswoman
is<br>
 undecided, tucks up her skirts to cross a gutter, dragging a
child by<br>
 the hand, which compels her to look out for the vehicles; she is
a<br>
 mother in public, and talks to her daughter; she carries money
in her<br>
 bag, and has open-work stockings on her feet; in winter, she
wears a<br>
 boa over her fur cloak; in summer, a shawl and a scarf; she
is<br>
 accomplished in the redundancies of dress.</p>

<p>"You will meet the fair Unknown again at the Italiens, at the
Opera,<br>
 at a ball. She will then appear under such a different aspect
that you<br>
 would think them two beings devoid of any analogy. The woman
has<br>
 emerged from those mysterious garments like a butterfly from its
silky<br>
 cocoon. She serves up, like some rare dainty, to your lavished
eyes,<br>
 the forms which her bodice scarcely revealed in the morning. At
the<br>
 theatre she never mounts higher than the second tier, excepting
at the<br>
 Italiens. You can there watch at your leisure the studied<br>
 deliberateness of her movements. The enchanting deceiver plays
off all<br>
 the little political artifices of her sex so naturally as to
exclude<br>
 all idea of art or premeditation. If she has a royally beautiful
hand,<br>
 the most perspicacious beholder will believe that it is
absolutely<br>
 necessary that she should twist, or refix, or push aside the
ringlet<br>
 or curl she plays with. If she has some dignity of profile, you
will<br>
 be persuaded that she is giving irony or grace to what she says
to her<br>
 neighbor, sitting in such a position as to produce the magical
effect<br>
 of the 'lost profile,' so dear to great painters, by which the
cheek<br>
 catches the high light, the nose is shown in clear outline,
the<br>
 nostrils are transparently rosy, the forehead squarely modeled,
the<br>
 eye has its spangle of fire, but fixed on space, and the
white<br>
 roundness of the chin is accentuated by a line of light. If she
has a<br>
 pretty foot, she will throw herself on a sofa with the
coquettish<br>
 grace of a cat in the sunshine, her feet outstretched without
your<br>
 feeling that her attitude is anything but the most charming
model ever<br>
 given to a sculptor by lassitude.</p>

<p>"Only the perfect lady is quite at her ease in full dress;
nothing<br>
 inconveniences her. You will never see her, like the woman of
the<br>
 citizen class, pulling up a refractory shoulder-strap, or
pushing down<br>
 a rebellious whalebone, or looking whether her tucker is doing
its<br>
 office of faithful guardian to two treasures of dazzling
whiteness, or<br>
 glancing in the mirrors to see if her head-dress is keeping its
place.<br>
 Her toilet is always in harmony with her character; she had had
time<br>
 to study herself, to learn what becomes her, for she has long
known<br>
 what does not suit her. You will not find her as you go out;
she<br>
 vanishes before the end of the play. If by chance she is to be
seen,<br>
 calm and stately, on the stairs, she is experiencing some
violent<br>
 emotion; she has to bestow a glance, to receive a promise.
Perhaps she<br>
 goes down so slowly on purpose to gratify the vanity of a slave
whom<br>
 she sometimes obeys. If your meeting takes place at a ball or
an<br>
 evening party, you will gather the honey, natural or affected of
her<br>
 insinuating voice; her empty words will enchant you, and she
will know<br>
 how to give them the value of thought by her inimitable
bearing."</p>

<p>"To be such a woman, is it not necessary to be very clever?"
asked the<br>
 Polish Count.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to have great taste," replied the Princesse
de<br>
 Cadignan.</p>

<p>"And in France taste is more than cleverness," said the
Russian.</p>

<p>"This woman's cleverness is the triumph of a purely plastic
art,"<br>
 Blondet went on. "You will not know what she said, but you will
be<br>
 fascinated. She will toss her head, or gently shrug her
white<br>
 shoulders; she will gild an insignificant speech with a charming
pout<br>
 and smile; or throw a Voltairean epigram into an 'Indeed!' an
'Ah!' a<br>
 'What then!' A jerk of her head will be her most pertinent form
of<br>
 questioning; she will give meaning to the movement by which she
twirls<br>
 a vinaigrette hanging to her finger by a ring. She gets an
artificial<br>
 grandeur out of superlative trivialities; she simply drops her
hand<br>
 impressively, letting it fall over the arm of her chair as
dewdrops<br>
 hang on the cup of a flower, and all is said--she has
pronounced<br>
 judgment beyond appeal, to the apprehension of the most obtuse.
She<br>
 knows how to listen to you; she gives you the opportunity of
shining,<br>
 and--I ask your modesty--those moments are rare?"</p>

<p>The candid simplicity of the young Pole, to whom Blondet
spoke, made<br>
 all the party shout with laughter.</p>

<p>"Now, you will not talk for half-an-hour with a
<i>bourgeoise</i> without<br>
 her alluding to her husband in one way or another," Blondet went
on<br>
 with unperturbed gravity; "whereas, even if you know that your
lady is<br>
 married, she will have the delicacy to conceal her husband
so<br>
 effectually that it will need the enterprise of Christopher
Columbus<br>
 to discover him. Often you will fail in the attempt
single-handed. If<br>
 you have had no opportunity of inquiring, towards the end of
the<br>
 evening you detect her gazing fixedly at a middle-aged man
wearing a<br>
 decoration, who bows and goes out. She has ordered her carriage,
and<br>
 goes.</p>

<p>"You are not the rose, but you have been with the rose, and
you go to<br>
 bed under the golden canopy of a delicious dream, which will
last<br>
 perhaps after Sleep, with his heavy finger, has opened the ivory
gates<br>
 of the temple of dreams.</p>

<p>"The lady, when she is at home, sees no one before four; she
is shrewd<br>
 enough always to keep you waiting. In her house you will
find<br>
 everything in good taste; her luxury is for hourly use, and
duly<br>
 renewed; you will see nothing under glass shades, no rags of
wrappings<br>
 hanging about, and looking like a pantry. You will find the
staircase<br>
 warmed. Flowers on all sides will charm your sight--flowers, the
only<br>
 gift she accepts, and those only from certain people, for
nosegays<br>
 live but a day; they give pleasure, and must be replaced; to her
they<br>
 are, as in the East, a symbol and a promise. The costly toys
of<br>
 fashion lie about, but not so as to suggest a museum or a
curiosity<br>
 shop. You will find her sitting by the fire in a low chair, from
which<br>
 she will not rise to greet you. Her talk will not now be what it
was<br>
 at the ball; there she was our creditor; in her own home she
owes you<br>
 the pleasure of her wit. These are the shades of which the lady
is a<br>
 marvelous mistress. What she likes in you is a man to swell
her<br>
 circle, an object for the cares and attentions which such women
are<br>
 now happy to bestow. Therefore, to attract you to her
drawing-room,<br>
 she will be bewitchingly charming. This especially is where you
feel<br>
 how isolated women are nowadays, and why they want a little
world of<br>
 their own, to which they may seem a constellation. Conversation
is<br>
 impossible without generalities."</p>

<p>"Yes," said de Marsay, "you have truly hit the fault of our
age. The<br>
 epigram--a volume in a word--no longer strikes, as it did in
the<br>
 eighteenth century, at persons or at things, but at squalid
events,<br>
 and it dies in a day."</p>

<p>"Hence," said Blondet, "the intelligence of the lady, if she
has any,<br>
 consists in casting doubts on everything. Here lies the
great<br>
 difference between two women; the townswoman is certainly
virtuous;<br>
 the lady does not know yet whether she is, or whether she always
will<br>
 be; she hesitates and struggles where the other refuses
point-blank<br>
 and falls full length. This hesitancy in everything is one of
the last<br>
 graces left to her by our horrible times. She rarely goes to
church,<br>
 but she will talk to you of religion; and if you have the good
taste<br>
 to affect Free-thought, she will try to convert you, for you
will have<br>
 opened the way for the stereotyped phrases, the head-shaking
and<br>
 gestures understood by all these women: 'For shame! I thought
you had<br>
 too much sense to attack religion. Society is tottering, and
you<br>
 deprive it of its support. Why, religion at this moment means
you and<br>
 me; it is property, and the future of our children! Ah! let us
not be<br>
 selfish! Individualism is the disease of the age, and religion
is the<br>
 only remedy; it unites families which your laws put asunder,'
and so<br>
 forth. Then she plunges into some neo-Christian speech sprinkled
with<br>
 political notions which is neither Catholic nor Protestant--but
moral?<br>
 Oh! deuced moral!--in which you may recognize a fag end of
every<br>
 material woven by modern doctrines, at loggerheads
together."</p>

<p>The women could not help laughing at the airs by which
Blondet<br>
 illustrated his satire.</p>

<p>"This explanation, dear Count Adam," said Blondet, turning to
the<br>
 Pole, "will have proved to you that the 'perfect lady'
represents the<br>
 intellectual no less than the political muddle, just as she
is<br>
 surrounded by the showy and not very lasting products of an
industry<br>
 which is always aiming at destroying its work in order to
replace it<br>
 by something else. When you leave her you say to yourself:
She<br>
 certainly has superior ideas! And you believe it all the more
because<br>
 she will have sounded your heart with a delicate touch, and have
asked<br>
 you your secrets; she affects ignorance, to learn everything;
there<br>
 are some things she never knows, not even when she knows them.
You<br>
 alone will be uneasy, you will know nothing of the state of her
heart.<br>
 The great ladies of old flaunted their love-affairs, with
newspapers<br>
 and advertisements; in these days the lady has her little
passion<br>
 neatly ruled like a sheet of music with its crotchets and
quavers and<br>
 minims, its rests, its pauses, its sharps to sign the key. A
mere weak<br>
 women, she is anxious not to compromise her love, or her
husband, or<br>
 the future of her children. Name, position, and fortune are no
longer<br>
 flags so respected as to protect all kinds of merchandise on
board.<br>
 The whole aristocracy no longer advances in a body to screen the
lady.<br>
 She has not, like the great lady of the past, the demeanor of
lofty<br>
 antagonism; she can crush nothing under foot, it is she who
would be<br>
 crushed. Thus she is apt at Jesuitical <i>mezzo termine</i>, she
is a<br>
 creature of equivocal compromises, of guarded proprieties,
of<br>
 anonymous passions steered between two reef-bound shores. She is
as<br>
 much afraid of her servants as an Englishwoman who lives in
dread of a<br>
 trial in the divorce-court. This woman--so free at a ball,
so<br>
 attractive out walking--is a slave at home; she is never
independent<br>
 but in perfect privacy, or theoretically. She must preserve
herself in<br>
 her position as a lady. This is her task.</p>

<p>"For in our day a woman repudiated by her husband, reduced to
a meagre<br>
 allowance, with no carriage, no luxury, no opera-box, none of
the<br>
 divine accessories of the toilet, is no longer a wife, a maid,
or a<br>
 townswoman; she is adrift, and becomes a chattel. The Carmelites
will<br>
 not receive a married woman; it would be bigamy. Would her lover
still<br>
 have anything to say to her? That is the question. Thus your
perfect<br>
 lady may perhaps give occasion to calumny, never to
slander."</p>

<p>"It is all so horribly true," said the Princesse de
Cadignan.</p>

<p>"And so," said Blondet, "our 'perfect lady' lives between
English<br>
 hypocrisy and the delightful frankness of the eighteenth
century--a<br>
 bastard system, symptomatic of an age in which nothing that
grows up<br>
 is at all like the thing that has vanished, in which transition
leads<br>
 nowhere, everything is a matter of degree; all the great
figures<br>
 shrink into the background, and distinction is purely personal.
I am<br>
 fully convinced that it is impossible for a woman, even if she
were<br>
 born close to a throne, to acquire before the age of
five-and-twenty<br>
 the encyclopaedic knowledge of trifles, the practice of
manoeuvring,<br>
 the important small things, the musical tones and harmony of
coloring,<br>
 the angelic bedevilments and innocent cunning, the speech and
the<br>
 silence, the seriousness and the banter, the wit and the
obtuseness,<br>
 the diplomacy and the ignorance which make up the perfect
lady."</p>

<p>"And where, in accordance with the sketch you have drawn,"
said<br>
 Mademoiselle des Touches to Emile Blondet, "would you class the
female<br>
 author? Is she a perfect lady, a woman <i>comme il
faut</i>?"</p>

<p>"When she has no genius, she is a woman <i>comme il n'en faut
pas</i>,"<br>
 Blondet replied, emphasizing the words with a stolen glance,
which<br>
 might make them seem praise frankly addressed to Camille Maupin.
"This<br>
 epigram is not mine, but Napoleon's," he added.</p>

<p>"You need not owe Napoleon any grudge on that score," said
Canalis,<br>
 with an emphatic tone and gesture. "It was one of his weaknesses
to be<br>
 jealous of literary genius--for he had his mean points. Who will
ever<br>
 explain, depict, or understand Napoleon? A man represented with
his<br>
 arms folded, and who did everything, who was the greatest force
ever<br>
 known, the most concentrated, the most mordant, the most acid of
all<br>
 forces; a singular genius who carried armed civilization in
every<br>
 direction without fixing it anywhere; a man who could do
everything<br>
 because he willed everything; a prodigious phenomenon of
will,<br>
 conquering an illness by a battle, and yet doomed to die of
disease in<br>
 bed after living in the midst of ball and bullets; a man with a
code<br>
 and a sword in his brain, word and deed; a clear-sighted spirit
that<br>
 foresaw everything but his own fall; a capricious politician
who<br>
 risked men by handfuls out of economy, and who spared three
heads--<br>
 those of Talleyrand, of Pozzo de Borgo, and of Metternich,<br>
 diplomatists whose death would have saved the French Empire, and
who<br>
 seemed to him of greater weight than thousands of soldiers; a
man to<br>
 whom nature, as a rare privilege, had given a heart in a frame
of<br>
 bronze; mirthful and kind at midnight amid women, and next
morning<br>
 manipulating Europe as a young girl might amuse herself by
splashing<br>
 water in her bath! Hypocritical and generous; loving tawdriness
and<br>
 simplicity; devoid of taste, but protecting the arts; and in
spite of<br>
 these antitheses, really great in everything by instinct or
by<br>
 temperament; Caesar at five-and-twenty, Cromwell at thirty; and
then,<br>
 like my grocer buried in Pere Lachaise, a good husband and a
good<br>
 father. In short, he improvised public works, empires, kings,
codes,<br>
 verses, a romance--and all with more range than precision. Did
he not<br>
 aim at making all Europe France? And after making us weigh on
the<br>
 earth in such a way as to change the laws of gravitation, he
left us<br>
 poorer than on the day when he first laid hands on us; while he,
who<br>
 had taken an empire by his name, lost his name on the frontier
of his<br>
 empire in a sea of blood and soldiers. A man all thought and
all<br>
 action, who comprehended Desaix and Fouche."</p>

<br>
"All despotism and all justice at the right moments. The true
king!"<br>
said de Marsay.

<p>"Ah! vat a pleashre it is to dichest vile you talk," said
Baron de<br>
 Nucingen.</p>

<p>"But do you suppose that the treat we are giving you is a
common one?"<br>
 asked Joseph Bridau. "If you had to pay for the charms of
conversation<br>
 as you do for those of dancing or of music, your fortune would
be<br>
 inadequate! There is no second performance of the same flash of
wit."</p>

<p>"And are we really so much deteriorated as these gentlemen
think?"<br>
 said the Princesse de Cadignan, addressing the women with a
smile at<br>
 once sceptical and ironical. "Because, in these days, under a
regime<br>
 which makes everything small, you prefer small dishes, small
rooms,<br>
 small pictures, small articles, small newspapers, small books,
does<br>
 that prove that women too have grown smaller? Why should the
human<br>
 heart change because you change your coat? In all ages the
passions<br>
 remain the same. I know cases of beautiful devotion, of
sublime<br>
 sufferings, which lack the publicity--the glory, if you
choose--which<br>
 formerly gave lustre to the errors of some women. But though one
may<br>
 not have saved a King of France, one is not the less an Agnes
Sorel.<br>
 Do you believe that our dear Marquise d'Espard is not the peer
of<br>
 Madame Doublet, or Madame du Deffant, in whose rooms so much
evil was<br>
 spoken and done? Is not Taglioni a match for Camargo? or
Malibran the<br>
 equal of Saint-Huberti? Are not our poets superior to those of
the<br>
 eighteenth century? If at this moment, through the fault of
the<br>
 Grocers who govern us, we have not a style of our own, had not
the<br>
 Empire its distinguishing stamp as the age of Louis XV. had, and
was<br>
 not its splendor fabulous? Have the sciences lost anything?"</p>

<p>"I am quite of your opinion, madame; the women of this age are
truly<br>
 great," replied the Comte de Vandenesse. "When posterity shall
have<br>
 followed us, will not Madame Recamier appear in proportions as
fine as<br>
 those of the most beautiful women of the past? We have made so
much<br>
 history that historians will be lacking. The age of Louis XIV.
had but<br>
 one Madame de Sevigne; we have a thousand now in Paris who
certainly<br>
 write better than she did, and who do not publish their
letters.<br>
 Whether the Frenchwoman be called 'perfect lady,' or great lady,
she<br>
 will always be <i>the</i> woman among women.</p>

<p>"Emile Blondet has given us a picture of the fascinations of a
woman<br>
 of the day; but, at need, this creature who bridles or shows
off, who<br>
 chirps out the ideas of Mr. This and Mr. That, would be heroic.
And it<br>
 must be said, your faults, mesdames, are all the more
poetical,<br>
 because they must always and under all circumstances be
surrounded by<br>
 greater perils. I have seen much of the world, I have studied
it<br>
 perhaps too late; but in cases where the illegality of your
feelings<br>
 might be excused, I have always observed the effects of I know
not<br>
 what chance--which you may call Providence--inevitably
overwhelming<br>
 such as we consider light women."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Madame de Vandenesse, "that we can be great in
other<br>
 ways----"</p>

<p>"Oh, let the Comte de Vandenesse preach to us!" exclaimed
Madame de<br>
 Serizy.</p>

<p>"With all the more reason because he has preached a great deal
by<br>
 example," said the Baronne de Nucingen.</p>

<p>"On my honor!" said General de Montriveau, "in all the
dramas--a word<br>
 you are very fond of," he said, looking at Blondet--"in which
the<br>
 finger of God has been visible, the most frightful I ever knew
was<br>
 very near being by my act----"</p>

<p>"Well, tell us all about it!" cried Lady Barimore; "I love
to<br>
 shudder!"</p>

<p>"It is the taste of a virtuous woman," replied de Marsay,
looking at<br>
 Lord Dudley's lovely daughter.</p>

<p>"During the campaign of 1812," General de Montriveau began, "I
was the<br>
 involuntary cause of a terrible disaster which may be of use to
you,<br>
 Doctor Bianchon," turning to me, "since, while devoting yourself
to<br>
 the human body, you concern yourself a good deal with the mind;
it may<br>
 tend to solve some of the problems of the will.</p>

<p>"I was going through my second campaign; I enjoyed danger, and
laughed<br>
 at everything, like the young and foolish lieutenant of
artillery that<br>
 I was. When we reached the Beresina, the army had, as you know,
lost<br>
 all discipline, and had forgotten military obedience. It was a
medley<br>
 of men of all nations, instinctively making their way from north
to<br>
 south. The soldiers would drive a general in rags and bare-foot
away<br>
 from their fire if he brought neither wood nor victuals. After
the<br>
 passage of this famous river disorder did not diminish. I had
come<br>
 quietly and alone, without food, out of the marshes of Zembin,
and was<br>
 wandering in search of a house where I might be taken in.
Finding none<br>
 or driven away from those I came across, happily towards evening
I<br>
 perceived a wretched little Polish farm, of which nothing can
give you<br>
 any idea unless you have seen the wooden houses of Lower
Normandy, or<br>
 the poorest farm-buildings of la Beauce. These dwellings consist
of a<br>
 single room, with one end divided off by a wooden partition,
the<br>
 smaller division serving as a store-room for forage.</p>

<p>"In the darkness of twilight I could just see a faint smoke
rising<br>
 above this house. Hoping to find there some comrades more<br>
 compassionate than those I had hitherto addressed, I boldly
walked as<br>
 far as the farm. On going in, I found the table laid.
Several<br>
 officers, and with them a woman--a common sight enough--were
eating<br>
 potatoes, some horseflesh broiled over the charcoal, and some
frozen<br>
 beetroots. I recognized among the company two or three
artillery<br>
 captains of the regiment in which I had first served. I was
welcomed<br>
 with a shout of acclamation, which would have amazed me greatly
on the<br>
 other side of the Beresina; but at this moment the cold was
less<br>
 intense; my fellow-officers were resting, they were warm, they
had<br>
 food, and the room, strewn with trusses of straw, gave the
promise of<br>
 a delightful night. We did not ask for so much in those days.
My<br>
 comrades could be philanthropists <i>gratis</i>--one of the
commonest ways<br>
 of being philanthropic. I sat down to eat on one of the bundles
of<br>
 straw.</p>

<p>"At the end of the table, by the side of the door opening into
the<br>
 smaller room full of straw and hay, sat my old colonel, one of
the<br>
 most extraordinary men I ever saw among all the mixed collection
of<br>
 men it has been my lot to meet. He was an Italian. Now, whenever
human<br>
 nature is truly fine in the lands of the South, it is really
sublime.<br>
 I do not know whether you have ever observed the extreme
fairness of<br>
 Italians when they are fair. It is exquisite, especially under
an<br>
 artificial light. When I read the fantastical portrait of
Colonel<br>
 Oudet sketched by Charles Nodier, I found my own sensations in
every<br>
 one of his elegant phrases. Italian, then, as were most of
the<br>
 officers of his regiment, which had, in fact, been borrowed by
the<br>
 Emperor from Eugene's army, my colonel was a tall man, at least
eight<br>
 or nine inches above the standard, and was admirably
proportioned--a<br>
 little stout perhaps, but prodigiously powerful, active, and
clean-<br>
 limbed as a greyhound. His black hair in abundant curls showed
up his<br>
 complexion, as white as a woman's; he had small hands, a shapely
foot,<br>
 a pleasant mouth, and an aquiline nose delicately formed, of
which the<br>
 tip used to become naturally pinched and white whenever he was
angry,<br>
 as happened often. His irascibility was so far beyond belief
that I<br>
 will tell you nothing about it; you will have the opportunity
of<br>
 judging of it. No one could be calm in his presence. I alone,
perhaps,<br>
 was not afraid of him; he had indeed taken such a singular fancy
to me<br>
 that he thought everything I did right. When he was in a rage
his brow<br>
 was knit and the muscles of the middle of his forehead set in a
delta,<br>
 or, to be more explicit, in Redgauntlet's horseshoe. This mark
was,<br>
 perhaps, even more terrifying than the magnetic flashes of his
blue<br>
 eyes. His whole frame quivered, and his strength, great as it
was in<br>
 his normal state, became almost unbounded.</p>

<p>"He spoke with a strong guttural roll. His voice, at least as
powerful<br>
 as that of Charles Nordier's Oudet, threw an incredible fulness
of<br>
 tone into the syllable or the consonant in which this burr
was<br>
 sounded. Though this faulty pronunciation was at times a grace,
when<br>
 commanding his men, or when he was excited, you cannot imagine,
unless<br>
 you had heard it, what force was expressed by this accent, which
at<br>
 Paris is so common. When the Colonel was quiescent, his blue
eyes were<br>
 angelically sweet, and his smooth brow had a most charming
expression.<br>
 On parade, or with the army of Italy, not a man could compare
with<br>
 him. Indeed, d'Orsay himself, the handsome d'Orsay, was eclipsed
by<br>
 our colonel on the occasion of the last review held by Napoleon
before<br>
 the invasion of Russia.</p>

<p>"Everything was in contrasts in this exceptional man. Passion
lives on<br>
 contrast. Hence you need not ask whether he exerted over women
the<br>
 irresistible influences to which our nature yields"--and the
general<br>
 looked at the Princesse de Cadignan--"as vitreous matter is
moulded<br>
 under the pipe of the glass-blower; still, by a singular
fatality--an<br>
 observer might perhaps explain the phenomenon--the Colonel was
not a<br>
 lady-killer, or was indifferent to such successes.</p>

<p>"To give you an idea of his violence, I will tell you in a few
words<br>
 what I once saw him do in a paroxysm of fury. We were dragging
our<br>
 guns up a very narrow road, bordered by a somewhat high slope on
one<br>
 side, and by thickets on the other. When we were half-way up we
met<br>
 another regiment of artillery, its colonel marching at the head.
This<br>
 colonel wanted to make the captain who was at the head of our
foremost<br>
 battery back down again. The captain, of course, refused; but
the<br>
 colonel of the other regiment signed to his foremost battery
to<br>
 advance, and in spite of the care the driver took to keep among
the<br>
 scrub, the wheel of the first gun struck our captain's right leg
and<br>
 broke it, throwing him over on the near side of his horse. All
this<br>
 was the work of a moment. Our Colonel, who was but a little way
off,<br>
 guessed that there was a quarrel; he galloped up, riding among
the<br>
 guns at the risk of falling with his horse's four feet in the
air, and<br>
 reached the spot, face to face with the other colonel, at the
very<br>
 moment when the captain fell, calling out 'Help!' No, our
Italian<br>
 colonel was no longer human! Foam like the froth of champagne
rose to<br>
 his lips; he roared inarticulately like a lion. Incapable of
uttering<br>
 a word, or even a cry, he made a terrific signal to his
antagonist,<br>
 pointing to the wood and drawing his sword. The two colonels
went<br>
 aside. In two seconds we saw our Colonel's opponent stretched on
the<br>
 ground, his skull split in two. The soldiers of his regiment
backed--<br>
 yes, by heaven, and pretty quickly too.</p>

<p>"The captain, who had been so nearly crushed, and who lay
yelping in<br>
 the puddle where the gun carriage had thrown him, had an Italian
wife,<br>
 a beautiful Sicilian of Messina, who was not indifferent to
our<br>
 Colonel. This circumstance had aggravated his rage. He was
pledged to<br>
 protect the husband, bound to defend him as he would have
defended the<br>
 woman herself.</p>

<p>"Now, in the hovel beyond Zembin, where I was so well
received, this<br>
 captain was sitting opposite to me, and his wife was at the
other end<br>
 of the table, facing the Colonel. This Sicilian was a little
woman<br>
 named Rosina, very dark, but with all the fire of the Southern
sun in<br>
 her black almond-shaped eyes. At this moment she was deplorably
thin;<br>
 her face was covered with dust, like fruit exposed to the
drought of a<br>
 highroad. Scarcely clothed in rags, exhausted by marches, her
hair in<br>
 disorder, and clinging together under a piece of a shawl tied
close<br>
 over her head, still she had the graces of a woman; her
movements were<br>
 engaging, her small rose mouth and white teeth, the outline of
her<br>
 features and figure, charms which misery, cold, and neglect had
not<br>
 altogether defaced, still suggested love to any man who could
think of<br>
 a woman. Rosina had one of those frames which are fragile in<br>
 appearance, but wiry and full of spring. Her husband, a
gentleman of<br>
 Piedmont, had a face expressive of ironical simplicity, if it
is<br>
 allowable to ally the two words. Brave and well informed, he
seemed to<br>
 know nothing of the connections which had subsisted between his
wife<br>
 and the Colonel for three years past. I ascribed this unconcern
to<br>
 Italian manners, or to some domestic secret; yet there was in
the<br>
 man's countenance one feature which always filled me with
involuntary<br>
 distrust. His under lip, which was thin and very restless,
turned down<br>
 at the corners instead of turning up, and this, as I thought,
betrayed<br>
 a streak of cruelty in a character which seemed so phlegmatic
and<br>
 indolent.</p>

<p>"As you may suppose the conversation was not very sparkling
when I<br>
 went in. My weary comrades ate in silence; of course, they asked
me<br>
 some questions, and we related our misadventures, mingled
with<br>
 reflections on the campaign, the generals, their mistakes,
the<br>
 Russians, and the cold. A minute after my arrival the colonel,
having<br>
 finished his meagre meal, wiped his moustache, bid us
good-night, shot<br>
 a black look at the Italian woman, saying, 'Rosina?' and then,
without<br>
 waiting for a reply, went into the little barn full of hay, to
bed.<br>
 The meaning of the Colonel's utterance was self-evident. The
young<br>
 wife replied by an indescribable gesture, expressing all the
annoyance<br>
 she could not feel at seeing her thralldom thus flaunted without
human<br>
 decency, and the offence to her dignity as a woman, and to
her<br>
 husband. But there was, too, in the rigid setting of her
features and<br>
 the tight knitting of her brows a sort of presentiment; perhaps
she<br>
 foresaw her fate. Rosina remained quietly in her place.</p>

<p>"A minute later, and apparently when the Colonel was snug in
his couch<br>
 of straw or hay, he repeated, 'Rosina?'</p>

<p>"The tone of this second call was even more brutally
questioning than<br>
 the first. The Colonel's strong burr, and the length which the
Italian<br>
 language allows to be given to vowels and the final
syllable,<br>
 concentrated all the man's despotism, impatience, and strength
of<br>
 will. Rosina turned pale, but she rose, passed behind us, and
went to<br>
 the Colonel.</p>

<p>"All the party sat in utter silence; I, unluckily, after
looking at<br>
 them all, began to laugh, and then they all laughed too.--'<i>Tu
ridi</i>?<br>
 --you laugh?' said the husband.</p>

<p>" 'On my honor, old comrade,' said I, becoming serious again,
'I<br>
 confess that I was wrong; I ask your pardon a thousand times,
and if<br>
 you are not satisfied by my apologies I am ready to give you<br>
 satisfaction.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh! it is not you who are wrong, it is I!' he replied
coldly.</p>

<p>"Thereupon we all lay down in the room, and before long all
were sound<br>
 asleep.</p>

<p>"Next morning each one, without rousing his neighbor or
seeking<br>
 companionship, set out again on his way, with that selfishness
which<br>
 made our rout one of the most horrible dramas of
self-seeking,<br>
 melancholy, and horror which ever was enacted under heaven.<br>
 Nevertheless, at about seven or eight hundred paces from our
shelter<br>
 we, most of us, met again and walked on together, like geese led
in<br>
 flocks by a child's wilful tyranny. The same necessity urged us
all.</p>

<p>"Having reached a knoll where we could still see the farmhouse
where<br>
 we had spent the night, we heard sounds resembling the roar of
lions<br>
 in the desert, the bellowing of bulls--no, it was a noise which
can be<br>
 compared to no known cry. And yet, mingling with this horrible
and<br>
 ominous roar, we could hear a woman's feeble scream. We all
looked<br>
 round, seized by I know not what impulse of terror; we no longer
saw<br>
 the house, but a huge bonfire. The farmhouse had been
barricaded, and<br>
 was in flames. Swirls of smoke borne on the wind brought us
hoarse<br>
 cries and an indescribable pungent smell. A few yards behind,
the<br>
 captain was quietly approaching to join our caravan; we gazed at
him<br>
 in silence, for no one dared question him; but he, understanding
our<br>
 curiosity, pointed to his breast with the forefinger of his
right<br>
 hand, and, waving the left in the direction of the fire, he
said,<br>
 '<i>Son'io</i>.'</p>

<p>"We all walked on without saying a word to him."</p>

<p>"There is nothing more terrible than the revolt of a sheep,"
said de<br>
 Marsay.</p>

<p>"It would be frightful to let us leave with this horrible
picture in<br>
 our memory," said Madame de Montcornet. "I shall dream of
it----"</p>

<p>"And what was the punishment of Monsieur de Marsay's 'First'?"
said<br>
 Lord Dudley, smiling.</p>

<p>"When the English are in jest, their foils have the buttons
on," said<br>
 Blondet.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Bianchon can tell us, for he saw her dying," replied
de<br>
 Marsay, turning to me.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "and her end was one of the most beautiful I
ever saw.<br>
 The Duke and I had spent the night by the dying woman's
pillow;<br>
 pulmonary consumption, in the last stage, left no hope; she had
taken<br>
 the sacrament the day before. The Duke had fallen asleep. The
Duchess,<br>
 waking at about four in the morning, signed to me in the most
touching<br>
 way, with a friendly smile, to bid me leave him to rest, and
she<br>
 meanwhile was about to die. She had become incredibly thin, but
her<br>
 face had preserved its really sublime outline and features. Her
pallor<br>
 made her skin look like porcelain with a light within. Her
bright eyes<br>
 and color contrasted with this languidly elegant complexion, and
her<br>
 countenance was full of expressive calm. She seemed to pity the
Duke,<br>
 and the feeling had its origin in a lofty tenderness which, as
death<br>
 approached, seemed to know no bounds. The silence was absolute.
The<br>
 room, softly lighted by a lamp, looked like every sickroom at
the hour<br>
 of death.</p>

<p>"At this moment the clock struck. The Duke awoke, and was in
despair<br>
 at having fallen asleep. I did not see the gesture of impatience
by<br>
 which he manifested the regret he felt at having lost sight of
his<br>
 wife for a few of the last minutes vouchsafed to him; but it is
quite<br>
 certain that any one but the dying woman might have
misunderstood it.<br>
 A busy statesman, always thinking of the interests of France,
the Duke<br>
 had a thousand odd ways on the surface, such as often lead to a
man of<br>
 genius being mistaken for a madman, and of which the explanation
lies<br>
 in the exquisiteness and exacting needs of their intellect. He
came to<br>
 seat himself in an armchair by his wife's side, and looked
fixedly at<br>
 her. The dying woman put her hand out a little way, took her
husband's<br>
 and clasped it feebly; and in a low but agitated voice she said,
'My<br>
 poor dear, who is left to understand you now?' Then she died,
looking<br>
 at him."</p>

<br>
"The stories the doctor tells us," said the Comte de
Vandenesse,<br>
"always leave a deep impression."

<p>"But a sweet one," said Mademoiselle des Touches, rising.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
